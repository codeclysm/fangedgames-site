      <title>Turmoil: first playtest</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had our first playtest session for Turmoil. I usually consider a playtest successful if it highlights problems that the rules create or can&amp;rsquo;t go around it. Given that it&amp;rsquo;s a campaign game, most of the problems will probably come out later. I asked the players if the game ran like Monstehearts. I received a yes, a no, and a non-committal shrug. It&amp;rsquo;s probably too early to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;characters:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Characters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made the characters in chat before the actual hangout, where we created the backgrounds. We play in the pictoresque &lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/London_Bridge,_Lake_Havasu_City_-_2011_(Aerial_Photo&#34;&gt;Lake Havasu City&lt;/a&gt;.jpg) with Ivan the Queen, Alec the Chosen, and Morrigan the Ghoul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan has a clique of few trusted people who play in his own baseball team (interestingly it&amp;rsquo;s a mixed gender team). They can protect themselves (bats) but they are different from him: he is milky white with blond hair, while they have darker skins and hair. Ivan wants Morrigan in his clique very bad, while thinks Alec is a threat to his status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec is a Chosen from a family of Chosen. They all are born in the same day, 21 of March. His father had an accident and now he&amp;rsquo;s in a wheelchair. He inherited the mantle of protector of the City. Alec has two friends who help with the slaughter: Willow and Terence (who was in Ivan&amp;rsquo;s clique before and went away because it was getting creepy). Alec also has someone who wants him dead: Vincent Bolton, the taxidermist (I came up with him).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrigan was one of the helpers of Alec&amp;rsquo;s family before dying in a bad fire, the same incident who caused Alec&amp;rsquo;s father to lose the use of his legs. Ivan and his clique disturbed her eternal sleep and now she&amp;rsquo;s back on earth craving fear and wanting to die for good. She thinks Alec smells like love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;First scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we forgot to highlight the stats (of course) and we went on with the first scene. In the classroom, where they were seeing a bad wildfire prevention PSA from a long time before (jokes jokes jokes). The professor didn&amp;rsquo;t care what they did, so Morrigan tried to talk to Alec, who &lt;em&gt;Shut her down&lt;/em&gt;. Hard. Like three times. First Morrigan was &lt;em&gt;Hurt&lt;/em&gt;, then Alec failed. My move was to introduce Ashley, a wannabe cheerleader with a caustic tongue. She shut Morrigan down (note that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a move with dice). Morrigan decided to enter her &lt;em&gt;Darkest Self&lt;/em&gt; to clear her &lt;em&gt;Hurt&lt;/em&gt; condition, and to &lt;em&gt;Lash out&lt;/em&gt;, scaring the hell out of her, feeding and escaping her darkest self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very quick darkest self. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s how I intended it to work. Maybe change the escape condition to something like &amp;ldquo;When you feel ashamed of what you&amp;rsquo;ve done&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;second-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Second scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec tried to intervene by grabbing Morrigan. Morrigan used her &lt;em&gt;Ending&lt;/em&gt; move to talk about her death, making him &lt;em&gt;Uneasy&lt;/em&gt;. Alec decided to flee. Ivan and Morrigan were left alone and started &lt;em&gt;Shutting themselves down&lt;/em&gt; and making themselves &lt;em&gt;Angry&lt;/em&gt;. They couldn&amp;rsquo;t flee because of the condition. Morrigan punched Ivan in the face. She failed. I said that Ivan received a punch, and was &lt;em&gt;Hurt&lt;/em&gt;. In the meantime I introduced the professor Wolf, who thundered to Morrigan to go to the Principal. Morrigan removed the &lt;em&gt;Angry&lt;/em&gt; condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very weak move. I sent her to the principal but then I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow up on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;third-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Third scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We followed Alec going home at night. I introduced a threat in the shape of a tall shadow monster, who vanished when he boldly threathened him. He went home to &lt;em&gt;Gaze into the abyss&lt;/em&gt; to get info about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fourth-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Fourth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan was at a training session. He was still Angry, so I said that he probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t performing so well. The coach said to him to go home. He &lt;em&gt;Manipulated him with a promise&lt;/em&gt; convincing him he&amp;rsquo;ll win the match. The coach said ok, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to show some control in the session. He &lt;em&gt;bottled the anger&lt;/em&gt; and managed to do well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about this. There&amp;rsquo;s no Keep your Cool move or Act Under Fire, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to handle this. And I still don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifth-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Fifth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrigan decided to visit Caleb, who didn&amp;rsquo;t know she was back from the dead. He greeted her with a loaded shotgun, but didn&amp;rsquo;t shoot when she came closer talking about her death and activating the &lt;em&gt;Ending&lt;/em&gt; move. He was scared, though, and it showed. She decided to change tactic and she kissed him &lt;em&gt;Making a Move&lt;/em&gt; on him. He started crying saying it was all his fault, that he didn&amp;rsquo;t try his best to save her. He told her she&amp;rsquo;d better go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sixth-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Sixth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see some Alec and willow action, so I framed a scene at Willow&amp;rsquo;s home, at dinner. Willow&amp;rsquo;s mom is shipping the two of them, but they only talked about how to drive the LongShadow out of town. They resolved to seek out a witch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;rsquo;t moves in this scene, and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion, to me as an MC it worked pretty much like a standard Monsterhearts first session. Meet the teen monsters, have them fool around a bit, meet the npcs, set up for greater drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s hope future sessions will show something more of the emergent mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turmoil: The queen</title>
      <link>http://www.fangedgames.com/post/turmoil-queen/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2016 14:44:29 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.fangedgames.com/post/turmoil-queen/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The queen is the leader of a clique of other youngsters. Their moves are about control and popularity. Their darkest self is about abusing power and trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stats:019218eaf65e751d3bb49f511f25d18b&#34;&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add 1 to one of these:
Hot 1, Cold 1, Volatile -1, Dark -1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moves:019218eaf65e751d3bb49f511f25d18b&#34;&gt;Moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get a Clique. It&amp;rsquo;s usually half a dozen close friends who look up at you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose 2 perks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are a lot (like a dozen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can defend themselves (they&amp;rsquo;re armed or trained)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They know people (who can sell them the cool drugs, or get them into the hot clubs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They share something (they are part of the same team or band)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are as family (they are ready to fight for each other)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose 2 downsides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are few (like 2 or 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are dangerous (they have no problem with violence and crime)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are scorned (by other popular groups)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are different from you (in a significant way)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They need something (from you, specifically)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose 2 moves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The shield&lt;/strong&gt;: When you shield yourself with someone from your clique, roll +Cold. On a 7-9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2.
- You aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid
- They aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid
- They aren&amp;rsquo;t hurt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many bodies&lt;/strong&gt;: When you make a move on someone and roll a 7-9, you can choose that someone else from your clique, who is present, is turned on instead of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And your enemies closer&lt;/strong&gt;: When someone betrays you, you gain a cold string over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/strong&gt;: When you ask someone in your clique to do something for you, roll +Hot. On a 7-9, they choose whether to do it or be Uneasy. On a 10+ they choose whether to do it or be Hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streaming&lt;/strong&gt;: When you probe the mind of someone in your clique, roll +Dark. On a 7-9, ask 1. On a 10+, ask 3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you think about ____?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your greates fear?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your greatest dream?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your beef against ____?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your stake in ____?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a miss, they can ask you 3 questions. You must answer truthfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;special-move:019218eaf65e751d3bb49f511f25d18b&#34;&gt;Special move&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you introduce someone to the clique, they become part of the clique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;darkest-self:019218eaf65e751d3bb49f511f25d18b&#34;&gt;Darkest self&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you are in your darkest self, you can use Puppeteer without rolling dice, as if you made a 10+. You escape your darkest self when someone in your clique stands up against you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;backstory:019218eaf65e751d3bb49f511f25d18b&#34;&gt;Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You really want someone to be part of your clique: Give them a hot string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You feel like someone is a threat to your status. Gain a cold string over them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Turmoil: The Ghoul</title>
      <link>http://www.fangedgames.com/post/turmoil-ghoul/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The ghoul is a monster that feels the urge to feed constantly of flesh, fear or chaos. Their moves are about morbidity and death. Their darkest self is about fighting the temptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stats:187e5027dd65d67127638505ec865d41&#34;&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add 1 to one of these:
Hot -1, Cold 1, Volatile 1, Dark -1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moves:187e5027dd65d67127638505ec865d41&#34;&gt;Moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hunger&lt;/strong&gt;: You have an hunger for (choose 1): flesh, chaos, power, fear. When you are rolling to pursue an hunger, add 1 to rolls. When you ignore a feeding opportunity, you are uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaffected&lt;/strong&gt;: When someone gives you a hot string, you can convert it into a cold string. You can&amp;rsquo;t do it later, you have to choose in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Rest for the Wicked&lt;/strong&gt;: When you die, wait it out. Some hours later, you wake up fully healed, in your darkest self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watchful Golem&lt;/strong&gt;: When you defend someone without them ever knowing about it, mark experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ending&lt;/strong&gt;: When someone listen when you talk about your death, roll +Cold. On a success they choose if they are Scared or Turned on. On a 10+ you gain a Cold string over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;special-move:187e5027dd65d67127638505ec865d41&#34;&gt;Special move&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone lashes out at you, you can decide to be Turned On instead of Scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;darkest-self:187e5027dd65d67127638505ec865d41&#34;&gt;Darkest self&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you are in your darkest self, whenever you ignore a feeding opportunity, your victim takes a Cold string on you. You escape your darkest self when you feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;backstory:187e5027dd65d67127638505ec865d41&#34;&gt;Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone smells like love. Give them 2 hot strings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone knows about your hunger. You gain a cold string over them. They gain a cold string over you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Turmoil: the Chosen</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The chosen is someone with great powers and a duty to fight evil. Their moves are about doing what&amp;rsquo;s necessary and steel themselves against hardships. Their darkest self is about refusing help and carry the weight of their responsibility alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stats:eb106ce578625776e086307f4ada4a20&#34;&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add 1 to one of these:
Hot -1, Cold 1, Volatile 1, Dark -1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moves:eb106ce578625776e086307f4ada4a20&#34;&gt;Moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mercy&lt;/strong&gt;: When you spare the life of someone you have a reason to kill, take a Cold string over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing Pains&lt;/strong&gt;: When you fail to protect your friends, mark experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold Blood&lt;/strong&gt;: When you gather your courage, you can roll+Cold. On a 10+ choose 3, On a 7-9 choose 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You aren&amp;rsquo;t scared anymore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You gain +1 to your next roll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You gain a cold string on the scariest person present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can ask a question about the situation to the MC (MC must answer truthfully)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take the blow&lt;/strong&gt;: When you leap into the way and take the blow instead of someone else, roll +Volatile. On a success you are hurt and they&amp;rsquo;re not. On a 10+ you can choose to be Scared instead of Hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light the way&lt;/strong&gt;: Whenever your friends follow through on your commands or your lead, they can use the Cold Blood Move (even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the books&lt;/strong&gt;: When you research a way to fight a threat, roll with the number of people assisting you. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask the MC a question (MC must answer truthfully)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain a cold string on your enemy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You aren&amp;rsquo;t uneasy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;special-move:eb106ce578625776e086307f4ada4a20&#34;&gt;Special move&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone else attends to your injuries, they take a Hot string over you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;darkest-self:eb106ce578625776e086307f4ada4a20&#34;&gt;Darkest self&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you are in your darkest self, as long as you&amp;rsquo;re on your own, you can&amp;rsquo;t be scared or uneasy. You escape your darkest self when there&amp;rsquo;s no more danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;backstory:eb106ce578625776e086307f4ada4a20&#34;&gt;Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to friends you can rely on for monster-slaying support. Name them and take a Cold string or a Hot string over them (your choice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone wants you dead. The MC gives them a name and two Cold string over you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Turmoil: first draft</title>
      <link>http://www.fangedgames.com/post/turmoil-first-draft/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2016 14:24:17 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.fangedgames.com/post/turmoil-first-draft/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Turmoil is an unofficial fork of &lt;a href=&#34;http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/monsterhearts/&#34;&gt;Monsterhearts&lt;/a&gt;.  It keeps most of the interesting bits but it changes profoundly the way they behave. It takes inspiration from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.magpiegames.com/masks/&#34;&gt;Masks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.angelfire.com/indie/btw/games/rustbelt.html&#34;&gt;the Rustbelt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core belief behind this rehaul is that players should never lose completely control over the game, even if their characters are helpless, but that control can be relinquished in some measure in order to make the game interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BE WARY: THIS IS NOT THE SECOND EDITION OF MONSTERHEARTS AND THIS CONTENT IS JUST FAN CONTENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conditions:698e58a815953b650f646ce2d71b8858&#34;&gt;Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conditions are completely different from Monsterhearts. I liked the idea of conditions that weakened you such as in masks, but I wanted them more crippling. The characters don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to manage them, so they are big obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are easier way to get rid of them, mostly by giving control over your character to someone else, such as in the case of strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conditions aren&amp;rsquo;t solely triggered by moves, but by the fiction as well. It&amp;rsquo;s common to ask &amp;ldquo;wait, are you angry?&amp;rdquo; to make the player realize they should take the condition. The player is always the only one who can decide what conditions to take, but be honest with yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you are turned on&lt;/strong&gt; you can&amp;rsquo;t spend strings. To remove it act on your impulses or give a hot string to someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you are angry&lt;/strong&gt; you can&amp;rsquo;t flee or make a move on someone. To remove it hurt someone or bottle it up. You can bottle it only 3 times. When you hurt someone you can start bottle it up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you are hurt&lt;/strong&gt; you can&amp;rsquo;t make 10+ on moves. To remove it seek help and heal or become your darkest self. If you were to become hurt while you already are hurt you become broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you are broken&lt;/strong&gt; you can&amp;rsquo;t make moves at all. To remove it seek help and heal or become your darkest self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you are scared&lt;/strong&gt; you can&amp;rsquo;t gain new strings. To remove it flee or give a cold string to someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you are uneasy&lt;/strong&gt; you can&amp;rsquo;t make a move on someone or shut someone down. To remove it flee or fling yourself into easy relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-moves:698e58a815953b650f646ce2d71b8858&#34;&gt;Basic moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the basic moves are used to provoke the other character into feeling something, while other are used to change the fictional positioning of the character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you make a move on someone&lt;/strong&gt; roll+hot. On a success they choose if they are turned on or uneasy. On a 7-9 you are turned on or uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you shut someone down&lt;/strong&gt; roll +cold. On a success they choose if they are hurt or angry. On a 10+ they lose whatever hot string they had on you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you lash out&lt;/strong&gt; roll+volatile. On a 10+ they choose two. On a 7-9 they choose one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they aren&amp;rsquo;t scared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they aren&amp;rsquo;t hurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you are hurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you flee&lt;/strong&gt; roll +volatile. On a 7-9 choose one. On a 10+ choose two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s not a big scene&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don&amp;rsquo;t give a cold string to who you&amp;rsquo;re fleeing from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you manipulate someone with a threat&lt;/strong&gt; roll+cold. On a 7-9 they must choose 1. On a 10+ they must choose 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they do what you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are scared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to make good on your threat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;when you manipulate someone with a promise&lt;/strong&gt; roll +hot. On a 7-9 they must choose 1. On a 10+ they must choose 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they do what you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are uneasy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to give something now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you gaze into the abyss&lt;/strong&gt; roll+dark. The abyss will always answer. On a 7-9 choose 2, on a 10+ choose three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It answers to what you asked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It cures you from a condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes you happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you are not uneasy when it&amp;rsquo;s finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;strings:698e58a815953b650f646ce2d71b8858&#34;&gt;Strings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two kind of strings, used to influence people in different ways. You can spend them as currency to make the actions against the people who gave you the string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot string&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a move on someone without rolling as if you made 7-9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulate someone with a promise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask a question from this list

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what do you like about me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what&amp;rsquo;s stopping you from being with me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what&amp;rsquo;s your greatest desire?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold string&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shut someone down without rolling as if you made 7-9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulate someone with a threat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask a question from this list

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what&amp;rsquo;s your greatest fear?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how can I force you to ____?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what do you really think of me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;darkest-self:698e58a815953b650f646ce2d71b8858&#34;&gt;Darkest self&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The darkest self is a Condition unique to a certain Skin, that changes the rules making it easier to behave in a certain manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vampire&lt;/strong&gt;. While you are your darkest self nobody can use a string against you, and you can use hot strings as cold strings and vice-versa. You exit your darkest self when someone more powerful than you puts you in your place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Werewolf&lt;/strong&gt;. While you are your darkest self you choose whether someone is hurt or afraid when you lash out. When you make a move on someone the option &amp;ldquo;uneasy&amp;rdquo; is replaced with &amp;ldquo;afraid&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;special-moves:698e58a815953b650f646ce2d71b8858&#34;&gt;Special moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special moves describe the messy relationship a Skin has with others. It may involve sex or romance or whatever interpretation the player gives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vampire&lt;/strong&gt;: when you deflect or refuse to answer questions about yourself gain 1xp. When you open your hearth to someone lose every string you possess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Werewolf&lt;/strong&gt;: when you claim someone as your own, they can summon you at their side whenever they want, until you claim someone else.﻿&lt;/p&gt;
