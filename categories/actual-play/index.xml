      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had the second session of Turmoil, with a new character: A ghost named Caroline, left to die in an infected orphanage a century ago. Lake Havasu city isn&amp;rsquo;t that old, but who cares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By putting the game under more stress we found a lot of things that weren&amp;rsquo;t working as intended. I&amp;rsquo;m calling this playtest a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;characters&#34;&gt;Characters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We presented the characters once more, by adding the Ghost. It was tricky because her connection to the other characters relied entirely on her past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered that she&amp;rsquo;s a century old girl with a love of modern sexy clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said that she spied Ivan while he was sleeping and that Alec knows about her ghostly status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-scene&#34;&gt;First scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another group scene, this time in the dining hall. Actually it was a collection of microscenes, because not everyone interacted at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;caroline-ashley&#34;&gt;Caroline &amp;amp; Ashley&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided that it would be cool if Caroline was actually friends with Ashley, and it was a great opportunity for me to exploit a triangle. So I had her explain how frightened she was the last night because she saw something following her. Of course Alec was listening and recognized the shadow of the LongShadow. Caroline promised her to accompany her home that evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;alec-morrigan&#34;&gt;Alec &amp;amp; Morrigan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec and Morrigan were a LOT friendlier today. They chatted and &lt;strong&gt;made moves on&lt;/strong&gt; each other, until a failure left me the ball. I tried to introduce the hunger issue, by describing how a girl nearby was scared and she knew. In retrospect I should have done that sooner, and used the Hard Move to trigger her darkest self. It would have been more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ivan-terence&#34;&gt;Ivan &amp;amp; Terence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terence behaved a bit like an asshole. He provoked Ivan, threatened him with violence and death. Ivan was &lt;strong&gt;angry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;lashed out&lt;/strong&gt; at Terence before &lt;strong&gt;fleeing&lt;/strong&gt; at the sight of professor Wolf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m playing Terence with something in mind here. He left Ivan&amp;rsquo;s Clique by accusing Ivan of playing with their minds, which as we will see later, it&amp;rsquo;s not true. Ivan is the sweetest Queen ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also discovered that the new Lash out move is bugged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;second-scene&#34;&gt;Second scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrigan left because she was &lt;strong&gt;Uneasy&lt;/strong&gt;, and brought Alec with her in an empty biology room. Unbeknownst to them Caroline followed them to spy on them. They &lt;strong&gt;made moves on&lt;/strong&gt; each other and started having sex, which funnily enough triggered the Ghost Special Move but not their own (they&amp;rsquo;re not triggered by sex anymore). Caroline was &lt;strong&gt;uneasy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;turned on&lt;/strong&gt;, and ran away making a scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;third-scene&#34;&gt;Third scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan and his clique are in the changing room, prepping for the match against Terence&amp;rsquo;s team. Ivan &lt;strong&gt;Gazed into the abyss&lt;/strong&gt; to know what to do with Morrigan, how to make her stay dead dead. The answer was simple enough: let her fear-starve for a week. Good luck with that. After that Andrew, shirtless, tried to get Ivan to talk about the match. Ivan rolled a failure with &lt;strong&gt;Streaming&lt;/strong&gt; and so I turned the move back on them. Andrew got the answers to &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your biggest dream&lt;/em&gt; (becoming a professional baseball player) and &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your greatest fear&lt;/em&gt; (his alien parents coming to take him away). Andrew reacted by hugging him and tell him that they will always be there for him. Ivan tried to &lt;em&gt;Make a Move on&lt;/em&gt; him but failed, so Andrew took a &lt;em&gt;Hot string&lt;/em&gt; on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could seem that his clique love Ivan unconditionally, but we&amp;rsquo;re still in the early phases of the game. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make their friendship look real before pushing. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how it will turn out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fourth-scene&#34;&gt;Fourth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caroline and Ashley went clubbing (or tried to). Caroline tried to &lt;strong&gt;make a move on&lt;/strong&gt; the bouncer but failed, and she received a hail of insults from a girl who was waiting in line. Caroline then decided to &lt;strong&gt;lash the hell out&lt;/strong&gt; of her, but failed again. I asked if it was right, and I made Ashley stop Caroline before she even punched, pointing at the dark back alley and claiming to have seen the Longshadow. I tried to scare Caroline while she went forth to investigate, and she seemed to almost want to &lt;strong&gt;flee&lt;/strong&gt;, when Ivan arrived with the cavalry, sending away the Longshadow. Caroline flung herself in the arms of Ivan, removing the &lt;strong&gt;Uneasy&lt;/strong&gt; condition (Ivan counts as an easy relief). They walked Caroline and Ashley home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifth-scene&#34;&gt;Fifth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec was celebrating his birthday at a restaurant with his father, Morrigan, Willow and Terence. Terence was sulky and talking shit about Ivan. Alec &lt;strong&gt;shut him down&lt;/strong&gt; and he shut up. Morrigan tried to let him talk, which he did, but Alec &lt;strong&gt;shut him down&lt;/strong&gt; again and Terence left, angry. Morrigan and Alec then started undressing each other with their eyes, until Caleb, the father, took Alec aside, reminding him that since Morrigan is dead she can&amp;rsquo;t bear children, and he MUST procreate, for the sake of the family and the city. The bloodline can&amp;rsquo;t end like this! Alec was positively &lt;strong&gt;hurt&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;angry&lt;/strong&gt; from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sixth-scene-ish&#34;&gt;Sixth scene-ish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan wanted to sneak into Alec&amp;rsquo;s house to retrieve info about Morrigan, so I asked Alec to come up with something interesting that Ivan could have found. He settled on Alec&amp;rsquo;s diary, which contained info also on Caroline. He then failed to &lt;strong&gt;flee&lt;/strong&gt;, so Alec and Caleb caught him red-handed, while we decided it was a good cliffhanger to stop the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-the-gm-side&#34;&gt;From the GM side&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to apply a different strategy from other Monsterhearts games. I tried to elicit emotional responses from the characters, then asked them How did they feel. They gained conditions from this, which prompted them to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also played the npcs by looking at their emotions, and making angry npcs lash out physically and verbally, scared npc seek protection, turned on npc become flustered, hurt npcs going away shutting the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s strange, like when I was trying to scare Caroline with the Longshadow (well, the Longshadow was trying to scare her). It reminded me a bit of Murderous Ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turmoil: first playtest part 1</title>
      <link>http://www.fangedgames.com/post/turmoil-first-playtest/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had our first playtest session for Turmoil. I usually consider a playtest successful if it highlights problems that the rules create or can&amp;rsquo;t go around it. Given that it&amp;rsquo;s a campaign game, most of the problems will probably come out later. I asked the players if the game ran like Monstehearts. I received a yes, a no, and a non-committal shrug. It&amp;rsquo;s probably too early to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;characters&#34;&gt;Characters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made the characters in chat before the actual hangout, where we created the backgrounds. We play in the pictoresque &lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/London_Bridge,_Lake_Havasu_City_-_2011_(Aerial_Photo).jpg&#34;&gt;Lake Havasu City&lt;/a&gt; with Ivan the Queen, Alec the Chosen, and Morrigan the Ghoul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan has a clique of few trusted people who play in his own baseball team (interestingly it&amp;rsquo;s a mixed gender team). They can protect themselves (bats) but they are different from him: he is milky white with blond hair, while they have darker skins and hair. Ivan wants Morrigan in his clique very bad, while thinks Alec is a threat to his status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec is a Chosen from a family of Chosen. They all are born in the same day, 21 of March. His father had an accident and now he&amp;rsquo;s in a wheelchair. He inherited the mantle of protector of the City. Alec has two friends who help with the slaughter: Willow and Terence (who was in Ivan&amp;rsquo;s clique before and went away because it was getting creepy). Alec also has someone who wants him dead: Vincent Bolton, the taxidermist (I came up with him).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrigan was one of the helpers of Alec&amp;rsquo;s family before dying in a bad fire, the same incident who caused Alec&amp;rsquo;s father to lose the use of his legs. Ivan and his clique disturbed her eternal sleep and now she&amp;rsquo;s back on earth craving fear and wanting to die for good. She thinks Alec smells like love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-scene&#34;&gt;First scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we forgot to highlight the stats (of course) and we went on with the first scene. In the classroom, where they were seeing a bad wildfire prevention PSA from a long time before (jokes jokes jokes). The professor didn&amp;rsquo;t care what they did, so Morrigan tried to talk to Alec, who &lt;em&gt;Shut her down&lt;/em&gt;. Hard. Like three times. First Morrigan was &lt;em&gt;Hurt&lt;/em&gt;, then Alec failed. My move was to introduce Ashley, a wannabe cheerleader with a caustic tongue. She shut Morrigan down (note that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a move with dice). Morrigan decided to enter her &lt;em&gt;Darkest Self&lt;/em&gt; to clear her &lt;em&gt;Hurt&lt;/em&gt; condition, and to &lt;em&gt;Lash out&lt;/em&gt;, scaring the hell out of her, feeding and escaping her darkest self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very quick darkest self. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s how I intended it to work. Maybe change the escape condition to something like &amp;ldquo;When you feel ashamed of what you&amp;rsquo;ve done&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;second-scene&#34;&gt;Second scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec tried to intervene by grabbing Morrigan. Morrigan used her &lt;em&gt;Ending&lt;/em&gt; move to talk about her death, making him &lt;em&gt;Uneasy&lt;/em&gt;. Alec decided to flee. Ivan and Morrigan were left alone and started &lt;em&gt;Shutting themselves down&lt;/em&gt; and making themselves &lt;em&gt;Angry&lt;/em&gt;. They couldn&amp;rsquo;t flee because of the condition. Morrigan punched Ivan in the face. She failed. I said that Ivan received a punch, and was &lt;em&gt;Hurt&lt;/em&gt;. In the meantime I introduced the professor Wolf, who thundered to Morrigan to go to the Principal. Morrigan removed the &lt;em&gt;Angry&lt;/em&gt; condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very weak move. I sent her to the principal but then I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow up on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;third-scene&#34;&gt;Third scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We followed Alec going home at night. I introduced a threat in the shape of a tall shadow monster, who vanished when he boldly threathened him. He went home to &lt;em&gt;Gaze into the abyss&lt;/em&gt; to get info about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fourth-scene&#34;&gt;Fourth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan was at a training session. He was still Angry, so I said that he probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t performing so well. The coach said to him to go home. He &lt;em&gt;Manipulated him with a promise&lt;/em&gt; convincing him he&amp;rsquo;ll win the match. The coach said ok, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to show some control in the session. He &lt;em&gt;bottled the anger&lt;/em&gt; and managed to do well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about this. There&amp;rsquo;s no Keep your Cool move or Act Under Fire, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to handle this. And I still don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifth-scene&#34;&gt;Fifth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrigan decided to visit Caleb, who didn&amp;rsquo;t know she was back from the dead. He greeted her with a loaded shotgun, but didn&amp;rsquo;t shoot when she came closer talking about her death and activating the &lt;em&gt;Ending&lt;/em&gt; move. He was scared, though, and it showed. She decided to change tactic and she kissed him &lt;em&gt;Making a Move&lt;/em&gt; on him. He started crying saying it was all his fault, that he didn&amp;rsquo;t try his best to save her. He told her she&amp;rsquo;d better go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sixth-scene&#34;&gt;Sixth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see some Alec and willow action, so I framed a scene at Willow&amp;rsquo;s home, at dinner. Willow&amp;rsquo;s mom is shipping the two of them, but they only talked about how to drive the LongShadow out of town. They resolved to seek out a witch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;rsquo;t moves in this scene, and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion, to me as an MC it worked pretty much like a standard Monsterhearts first session. Meet the teen monsters, have them fool around a bit, meet the npcs, set up for greater drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s hope future sessions will show something more of the emergent mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
