      <title>Turmoil: first playtest</title>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had our first playtest session for Turmoil. I usually consider a playtest successful if it highlights problems that the rules create or can&amp;rsquo;t go around it. Given that it&amp;rsquo;s a campaign game, most of the problems will probably come out later. I asked the players if the game ran like Monstehearts. I received a yes, a no, and a non-committal shrug. It&amp;rsquo;s probably too early to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;characters:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Characters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made the characters in chat before the actual hangout, where we created the backgrounds. We play in the pictoresque &lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/London_Bridge,_Lake_Havasu_City_-_2011_(Aerial_Photo&#34;&gt;Lake Havasu City&lt;/a&gt;.jpg) with Ivan the Queen, Alec the Chosen, and Morrigan the Ghoul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan has a clique of few trusted people who play in his own baseball team (interestingly it&amp;rsquo;s a mixed gender team). They can protect themselves (bats) but they are different from him: he is milky white with blond hair, while they have darker skins and hair. Ivan wants Morrigan in his clique very bad, while thinks Alec is a threat to his status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec is a Chosen from a family of Chosen. They all are born in the same day, 21 of March. His father had an accident and now he&amp;rsquo;s in a wheelchair. He inherited the mantle of protector of the City. Alec has two friends who help with the slaughter: Willow and Terence (who was in Ivan&amp;rsquo;s clique before and went away because it was getting creepy). Alec also has someone who wants him dead: Vincent Bolton, the taxidermist (I came up with him).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrigan was one of the helpers of Alec&amp;rsquo;s family before dying in a bad fire, the same incident who caused Alec&amp;rsquo;s father to lose the use of his legs. Ivan and his clique disturbed her eternal sleep and now she&amp;rsquo;s back on earth craving fear and wanting to die for good. She thinks Alec smells like love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;First scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we forgot to highlight the stats (of course) and we went on with the first scene. In the classroom, where they were seeing a bad wildfire prevention PSA from a long time before (jokes jokes jokes). The professor didn&amp;rsquo;t care what they did, so Morrigan tried to talk to Alec, who &lt;em&gt;Shut her down&lt;/em&gt;. Hard. Like three times. First Morrigan was &lt;em&gt;Hurt&lt;/em&gt;, then Alec failed. My move was to introduce Ashley, a wannabe cheerleader with a caustic tongue. She shut Morrigan down (note that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a move with dice). Morrigan decided to enter her &lt;em&gt;Darkest Self&lt;/em&gt; to clear her &lt;em&gt;Hurt&lt;/em&gt; condition, and to &lt;em&gt;Lash out&lt;/em&gt;, scaring the hell out of her, feeding and escaping her darkest self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very quick darkest self. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s how I intended it to work. Maybe change the escape condition to something like &amp;ldquo;When you feel ashamed of what you&amp;rsquo;ve done&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;second-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Second scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec tried to intervene by grabbing Morrigan. Morrigan used her &lt;em&gt;Ending&lt;/em&gt; move to talk about her death, making him &lt;em&gt;Uneasy&lt;/em&gt;. Alec decided to flee. Ivan and Morrigan were left alone and started &lt;em&gt;Shutting themselves down&lt;/em&gt; and making themselves &lt;em&gt;Angry&lt;/em&gt;. They couldn&amp;rsquo;t flee because of the condition. Morrigan punched Ivan in the face. She failed. I said that Ivan received a punch, and was &lt;em&gt;Hurt&lt;/em&gt;. In the meantime I introduced the professor Wolf, who thundered to Morrigan to go to the Principal. Morrigan removed the &lt;em&gt;Angry&lt;/em&gt; condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very weak move. I sent her to the principal but then I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow up on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;third-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Third scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We followed Alec going home at night. I introduced a threat in the shape of a tall shadow monster, who vanished when he boldly threathened him. He went home to &lt;em&gt;Gaze into the abyss&lt;/em&gt; to get info about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fourth-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Fourth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan was at a training session. He was still Angry, so I said that he probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t performing so well. The coach said to him to go home. He &lt;em&gt;Manipulated him with a promise&lt;/em&gt; convincing him he&amp;rsquo;ll win the match. The coach said ok, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to show some control in the session. He &lt;em&gt;bottled the anger&lt;/em&gt; and managed to do well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about this. There&amp;rsquo;s no Keep your Cool move or Act Under Fire, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to handle this. And I still don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifth-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Fifth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrigan decided to visit Caleb, who didn&amp;rsquo;t know she was back from the dead. He greeted her with a loaded shotgun, but didn&amp;rsquo;t shoot when she came closer talking about her death and activating the &lt;em&gt;Ending&lt;/em&gt; move. He was scared, though, and it showed. She decided to change tactic and she kissed him &lt;em&gt;Making a Move&lt;/em&gt; on him. He started crying saying it was all his fault, that he didn&amp;rsquo;t try his best to save her. He told her she&amp;rsquo;d better go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sixth-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Sixth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see some Alec and willow action, so I framed a scene at Willow&amp;rsquo;s home, at dinner. Willow&amp;rsquo;s mom is shipping the two of them, but they only talked about how to drive the LongShadow out of town. They resolved to seek out a witch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;rsquo;t moves in this scene, and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion, to me as an MC it worked pretty much like a standard Monsterhearts first session. Meet the teen monsters, have them fool around a bit, meet the npcs, set up for greater drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s hope future sessions will show something more of the emergent mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
