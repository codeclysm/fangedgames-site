<blockquote>
<p>Somewhere out there in the vast nothingness of space,<br>
Somewhere far away in space and time,<br>
Staring upward at the gleaming stars in the obsidian sky,<br>
We’re marooned on a small island, in an endless sea<br>
Confined to a tiny spit of sand, unable to escape,<br>
But tonight, on this small planet, on earth<br>
We’re going to rock civilization…<br>
  – Lyrics from “Prelude/Slam”, Pendulum</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starchilds is a scifi game about teenagers. The main idea came to me while looking at the stars and wondering whether I would gaze at them at the same way if I were living among them.</p>

<h2 id="prep">Prep</h2>

<ul>
<li>Choose the setting: space station, alien planet, bla bla</li>
<li>Answer: what do we have that on earth is lacking?</li>
<li>Answer:what do we lack here that they have on earth?</li>
<li>Choose the playbooks</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s a pbta, so we have attributes!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Void</strong> measure your perceived distance from others and the world</li>
<li><strong>Mass</strong> measure the impact you can have on others</li>
<li><strong>Light</strong> measure how much you are looked upon by others.</li>
</ul>

<p>The basic moves are grouped by Mood. Every player will start with a Mood, and the Mood will probably change multiple times during the game.</p>

<p>The Moods are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blue</strong>: Thoughtful, longing, sad</li>
<li><strong>Hot</strong>: Excited, ready for action</li>
<li><strong>Sick</strong>: Uneasy, on edge, worried.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you currently have a Mood, you gain experience points when you use moves in that Mood group. Moreover, there are other benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Blue</em>: you have access to the move Stargaze, which allows you to see the truth in people.</li>
<li><em>Hot</em>: if you’re doing things without caring about consequences, you get +1 at rolls</li>
<li><em>Sick</em>: Rolls against you can’t reach the full success.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes a move will tell you that you are <strong>Hurt</strong>. <em>Hurt</em> is not a Mood, so you can be <em>Blue</em> AND <em>Hurt</em> at the same time.</p>

<p>When you are <em>Hurt</em> you can’t reach the full success of your rolls. If you would become <em>Hurt</em> when you already are Hurt, you become <em>Broken</em>.</p>

<p>When you are <em>Broken</em> you can’t use moves at all. You can still play though.</p>

<p>To Heal from <em>Broken</em> to <em>Hurt</em>, or from <em>Hurt</em> to <em>Ok</em>, wait until time passes, or be healed by another character.</p>

<h2 id="blue-moves">Blue moves</h2>

<h3 id="stargaze">Stargaze</h3>

<p>When you gaze at the stars voice your doubts and questions to the distant skies, choose another player and roll +Void.
On a 10+ they are Blue and they have to answer one of your questions
On a 7-9, they may lie about it.
On a miss, the MC will answer</p>

<h3 id="razor-tongue">Razor tongue</h3>

<p>When you say something to hurt someone, roll +Mass
On a 10+, they are Hurt
On a 7-9, they choose if they are Hurt or Sick. If they already are Sick, they can’t choose this option.</p>

<h2 id="hot-moves">Hot moves</h2>

<h3 id="make-a-move">Make a move</h3>

<p>When you make a move on someone, roll +Light
On a 10+ they choose:</p>

<ul>
<li>Act on their impulses and be Hot</li>
<li>Refuse you and be Sick</li>
</ul>

<p>On a 7-9 they can use Razor Tongue as if they rolled a 7-9</p>

<h3 id="lash-out">Lash out</h3>

<p>When you lash out at someone, roll +Mass
On a 10+ they choose 2:</p>

<ul>
<li>they are Hurt</li>
<li>they give you something you asked for</li>
<li>they are Hot</li>
</ul>

<p>On a 7-9 they choose all 3.</p>

<h2 id="sick-moves-lol">Sick moves (lol)</h2>

<h3 id="watch-out">Watch out</h3>

<p>When you avoid problems, roll +Void
On a success, you are Blue
On a 10+ your problems will give you pause (but won’t disappear)</p>

<h3 id="take-care">Take care</h3>

<p>When you take care of someone, roll +Light
On a 7-9 they choose if they are Healed or Blue.
On a 10+, if they chose to be Healed, you are Healed too</p>
