&lt;p&gt;Turmoil is an unofficial fork of &lt;a href=&#34;http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/monsterhearts/&#34;&gt;Monsterhearts&lt;/a&gt;.  It keeps most of the interesting bits but it changes profoundly the way they behave. It takes inspiration from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.magpiegames.com/masks/&#34;&gt;Masks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.angelfire.com/indie/btw/games/rustbelt.html&#34;&gt;the Rustbelt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core belief behind this game is that players should never lose completely control over the game, even if their characters are helpless, but that control must be relinquished in some measure in order to make the game interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BE WARY: THIS IS NOT THE SECOND EDITION OF MONSTERHEARTS AND THIS CONTENT IS JUST FAN CONTENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conditions:75f1fa200cd8f31a038531a0e337cbd8&#34;&gt;Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A condition is a particular emotion your character is feeling. Because these are teenagers, all these conditions are bad news. They expose weakness and sometimes they are debilitating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the times a certain move will force a player to choose between two different conditions, but a condition can be gained in other ways too. It&amp;rsquo;s common to ask &amp;ldquo;wait, are you angry?&amp;rdquo; to make the player realize they should take the condition. The player is the only one that can decide which condition to take, but it helps to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turned on&lt;/strong&gt; means that something (or someone) is making you feel hot and your stomach fill with butterflies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you gain this condition tell the others how it shows on your character. If you already had this condition give a Hot String to whoever caused you to take it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you have this condition, whoever turned you (now or in the past) can Manipulate you with a promise of intimacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove the condition give in to your impulses (with or without the person who turned you on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angry&lt;/strong&gt; means that something (or someone) has made you furious, and you&amp;rsquo;d like to punch them in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you gain this condition tell the others how it shows on your character. If you already had this condition give a Cold String to whoever caused you to take it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you have this condition, no one can Manipulate you with a Threat or a Promise, but neither can you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove the condition hurt someone or break something, or wait until the end of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hurt&lt;/strong&gt; means that you&amp;rsquo;re suffering, from physical or psychological wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you gain this condition tell the others how you&amp;rsquo;re hurt. If you already had this condition take the condition Broken instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you have this condition, no matter the results of your dice rolls, you cannot have a 10+ on your dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove the condition seek help and heal, or become your darkest self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broken&lt;/strong&gt; means that you cannot bring yourself to do shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you gain this condition tell the others why the world betrayed you. If you already had this condition you die. Tell the others how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you have this condition, you cannot roll dice at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove the condition seek help and heal (becoming hurt), or become your darkest self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scared&lt;/strong&gt; means that you&amp;rsquo;re worried and frightened of something or someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you gain this condition tell the others what you have to lose. If you already had this condition you have to Run Away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you have this condition, whoever can take a Cold String on you by being menacing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove this condition you have to Run Away, or wait until the end of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uneasy&lt;/strong&gt; means that something&amp;rsquo;s making you uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you gain this condition tell the others why this situation is making you uncomfortable. If you already had this condition give a Cold String to whoever caused you to take it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you have this condition, everyone has a +1 bonus using moves against you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove this condition fling yourself into easy relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that some conditions don&amp;rsquo;t clear at the end of a scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-moves:75f1fa200cd8f31a038531a0e337cbd8&#34;&gt;Basic Moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the basic moves are used to provoke the other character into feeling something, while other are used to change the fictional positioning of the character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you make a move on someone&lt;/strong&gt; roll+hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a success they choose if they are turned on or uneasy. On a 7-9 you have to choose too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you shut someone down&lt;/strong&gt; roll +cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a success they choose if they are hurt or angry. On a 10+ they lose whatever hot string they had on you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you lash out&lt;/strong&gt; roll+volatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a 10+ they are hurt. On a 10+ they also choose if they are Scared or if they give you a Cold String.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you flee&lt;/strong&gt; roll +volatile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a success you find youself somewhere else. On a 7-9 choose if you prefer to make a big scene or to find yourself in big trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you manipulate someone with a threat&lt;/strong&gt; roll+cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a 10+ they are scared, and choose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They do what you asked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t do what you asked, and you gain a Cold String over them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a 7-9 they choose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They do what you asked and they&amp;rsquo;re not scared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don&amp;rsquo;t do what you asked and they are scared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They give (or promise) you something else of value, and they are scared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you manipulate someone with a promise&lt;/strong&gt; roll+cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a 10+ they choose:
- They do what you want
- They don&amp;rsquo;t do what you want and they are uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a 7-9 they can also choose:
- They do what you want if you give them something more.
- They give (or promise) you something else of value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you gaze into the abyss&lt;/strong&gt; roll+dark. The abyss will always answer. On a 7-9 choose 2, on a 10+ choose three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It answers to what you asked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It cures you from a condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes you happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you are not uneasy when it&amp;rsquo;s finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You gain a Hot String or a Cold string on the subject of your visions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;strings:75f1fa200cd8f31a038531a0e337cbd8&#34;&gt;Strings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two kind of strings, used to influence people in different ways. You can spend them as currency to make the actions against the people who gave you the string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot string&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a move on someone without rolling as if you made 7-9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulate someone with a promise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask a question from this list

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what do you like about me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what&amp;rsquo;s stopping you from being with me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what&amp;rsquo;s your greatest desire?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold string&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shut someone down without rolling as if you made 7-9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulate someone with a threat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask a question from this list

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what&amp;rsquo;s your greatest fear?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how can I force you to ____?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what do you really think of me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Turmoil: first playtest part 2</title>
      <link>http://www.fangedgames.com/post/turmoil-first-playtest-2/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had the second session of Turmoil, with a new character: A ghost named Caroline, left to die in an infected orphanage a century ago. Lake Havasu city isn&amp;rsquo;t that old, but who cares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By putting the game under more stress we found a lot of things that weren&amp;rsquo;t working as intended. I&amp;rsquo;m calling this playtest a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;characters:80f5d0261a42adad12d9b0e2e4c80033&#34;&gt;Characters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We presented the characters once more, by adding the Ghost. It was tricky because her connection to the other characters relied entirely on her past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discovered that she&amp;rsquo;s a century old girl with a love of modern sexy clothes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said that she spied Ivan while he was sleeping and that Alec knows about her ghostly status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-scene:80f5d0261a42adad12d9b0e2e4c80033&#34;&gt;First scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another group scene, this time in the dining hall. Actually it was a collection of microscenes, because not everyone interacted at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;caroline-ashley:80f5d0261a42adad12d9b0e2e4c80033&#34;&gt;Caroline &amp;amp; Ashley&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided that it would be cool if Caroline was actually friends with Ashley, and it was a great opportunity for me to exploit a triangle. So I had her explain how frightened she was the last night because she saw something following her. Of course Alec was listening and recognized the shadow of the LongShadow. Caroline promised her to accompany her home that evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;alec-morrigan:80f5d0261a42adad12d9b0e2e4c80033&#34;&gt;Alec &amp;amp; Morrigan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec and Morrigan were a LOT friendlier today. They chatted and &lt;strong&gt;made moves on&lt;/strong&gt; each other, until a failure left me the ball. I tried to introduce the hunger issue, by describing how a girl nearby was scared and she knew. In retrospect I should have done that sooner, and used the Hard Move to trigger her darkest self. It would have been more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ivan-terence:80f5d0261a42adad12d9b0e2e4c80033&#34;&gt;Ivan &amp;amp; Terence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terence behaved a bit like an asshole. He provoked Ivan, threatened him with violence and death. Ivan was &lt;strong&gt;angry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;lashed out&lt;/strong&gt; at Terence before &lt;strong&gt;fleeing&lt;/strong&gt; at the sight of professor Wolf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m playing Terence with something in mind here. He left Ivan&amp;rsquo;s Clique by accusing Ivan of playing with their minds, which as we will see later, it&amp;rsquo;s not true. Ivan is the sweetest Queen ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also discovered that the new Lash out move is bugged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;second-scene:80f5d0261a42adad12d9b0e2e4c80033&#34;&gt;Second scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrigan left because she was &lt;strong&gt;Uneasy&lt;/strong&gt;, and brought Alec with her in an empty biology room. Unbeknownst to them Caroline followed them to spy on them. They &lt;strong&gt;made moves on&lt;/strong&gt; each other and started having sex, which funnily enough triggered the Ghost Special Move but not their own (they&amp;rsquo;re not triggered by sex anymore). Caroline was &lt;strong&gt;uneasy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;turned on&lt;/strong&gt;, and ran away making a scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;third-scene:80f5d0261a42adad12d9b0e2e4c80033&#34;&gt;Third scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan and his clique are in the changing room, prepping for the match against Terence&amp;rsquo;s team. Ivan &lt;strong&gt;Gazed into the abyss&lt;/strong&gt; to know what to do with Morrigan, how to make her stay dead dead. The answer was simple enough: let her fear-starve for a week. Good luck with that. After that Andrew, shirtless, tried to get Ivan to talk about the match. Ivan rolled a failure with &lt;strong&gt;Streaming&lt;/strong&gt; and so I turned the move back on them. Andrew got the answers to &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your biggest dream&lt;/em&gt; (becoming a professional baseball player) and &lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your greatest fear&lt;/em&gt; (his alien parents coming to take him away). Andrew reacted by hugging him and tell him that they will always be there for him. Ivan tried to &lt;em&gt;Make a Move on&lt;/em&gt; him but failed, so Andrew took a &lt;em&gt;Hot string&lt;/em&gt; on him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could seem that his clique love Ivan unconditionally, but we&amp;rsquo;re still in the early phases of the game. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make their friendship look real before pushing. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how it will turn out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fourth-scene:80f5d0261a42adad12d9b0e2e4c80033&#34;&gt;Fourth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caroline and Ashley went clubbing (or tried to). Caroline tried to &lt;strong&gt;make a move on&lt;/strong&gt; the bouncer but failed, and she received a hail of insults from a girl who was waiting in line. Caroline then decided to &lt;strong&gt;lash the hell out&lt;/strong&gt; of her, but failed again. I asked if it was right, and I made Ashley stop Caroline before she even punched, pointing at the dark back alley and claiming to have seen the Longshadow. I tried to scare Caroline while she went forth to investigate, and she seemed to almost want to &lt;strong&gt;flee&lt;/strong&gt;, when Ivan arrived with the cavalry, sending away the Longshadow. Caroline flung herself in the arms of Ivan, removing the &lt;strong&gt;Uneasy&lt;/strong&gt; condition (Ivan counts as an easy relief). They walked Caroline and Ashley home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifth-scene:80f5d0261a42adad12d9b0e2e4c80033&#34;&gt;Fifth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec was celebrating his birthday at a restaurant with his father, Morrigan, Willow and Terence. Terence was sulky and talking shit about Ivan. Alec &lt;strong&gt;shut him down&lt;/strong&gt; and he shut up. Morrigan tried to let him talk, which he did, but Alec &lt;strong&gt;shut him down&lt;/strong&gt; again and Terence left, angry. Morrigan and Alec then started undressing each other with their eyes, until Caleb, the father, took Alec aside, reminding him that since Morrigan is dead she can&amp;rsquo;t bear children, and he MUST procreate, for the sake of the family and the city. The bloodline can&amp;rsquo;t end like this! Alec was positively &lt;strong&gt;hurt&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;angry&lt;/strong&gt; from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sixth-scene-ish:80f5d0261a42adad12d9b0e2e4c80033&#34;&gt;Sixth scene-ish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan wanted to sneak into Alec&amp;rsquo;s house to retrieve info about Morrigan, so I asked Alec to come up with something interesting that Ivan could have found. He settled on Alec&amp;rsquo;s diary, which contained info also on Caroline. He then failed to &lt;strong&gt;flee&lt;/strong&gt;, so Alec and Caleb caught him red-handed, while we decided it was a good cliffhanger to stop the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-the-gm-side:80f5d0261a42adad12d9b0e2e4c80033&#34;&gt;From the GM side&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to apply a different strategy from other Monsterhearts games. I tried to elicit emotional responses from the characters, then asked them How did they feel. They gained conditions from this, which prompted them to act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also played the npcs by looking at their emotions, and making angry npcs lash out physically and verbally, scared npc seek protection, turned on npc become flustered, hurt npcs going away shutting the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s strange, like when I was trying to scare Caroline with the Longshadow (well, the Longshadow was trying to scare her). It reminded me a bit of Murderous Ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turmoil: The Ghost</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The ghost is lonely and spooky. Their moves are about alienating others. Their darkest self is about craving and obtaining attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stats:8c5bdc95df153d40871ba850e4ce1f06&#34;&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add 1 to one of these:
Hot -1, Cold 1, Volatile -1, Dark 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moves:8c5bdc95df153d40871ba850e4ce1f06&#34;&gt;Moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trauma&lt;/strong&gt;: When someone or something reminds you of your death, roll +dark. On a 10+ choose 1. On a 7-9 choose 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are scared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are turned on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are hurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are unable to speak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are unable to move&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then choose 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vengeful&lt;/strong&gt;: When you lash out to get revenge, roll +dark instead of +volatile. They can&amp;rsquo;t choose that they aren&amp;rsquo;t scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hungry ghost&lt;/strong&gt;: When someone dump their emotional problems on you, roll +dark. On a 10+ choose 2. On a 7-9 choose 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mark experience&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain a cold string on them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are no longer uneasy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are no longer hurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dissipate&lt;/strong&gt;: When you successfully flee by going through walls, gain a Cold String over whom you were running from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead people can&amp;rsquo;t keep secrets&lt;/strong&gt;: You can spend a Cold string on someone to ask them to reveal a secret of them. If you use it to Shut them Down, you add+1 to your roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;special-move:8c5bdc95df153d40871ba850e4ce1f06&#34;&gt;Special move&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you secretly witness someone in their most intimate moments, perhaps showering or sleeping, gain a Hot String on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;darkest-self:8c5bdc95df153d40871ba850e4ce1f06&#34;&gt;Darkest self&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you are in your darkest self, no one can see you, feel you, or hear you. You can still move small inanimate objects. When someone acknowledge your presence, they choose if they are Uneasy or Afraid. You escape your darkest self when someone gives you the attention you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;backstory:8c5bdc95df153d40871ba850e4ce1f06&#34;&gt;Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone knows you&amp;rsquo;re dead. They gain a cold string over you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You witnessed someone&amp;rsquo;s while they were sleeping. They gain a hot string over you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we had our first playtest session for Turmoil. I usually consider a playtest successful if it highlights problems that the rules create or can&amp;rsquo;t go around it. Given that it&amp;rsquo;s a campaign game, most of the problems will probably come out later. I asked the players if the game ran like Monstehearts. I received a yes, a no, and a non-committal shrug. It&amp;rsquo;s probably too early to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;characters:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Characters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made the characters in chat before the actual hangout, where we created the backgrounds. We play in the pictoresque &lt;a href=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/London_Bridge,_Lake_Havasu_City_-_2011_(Aerial_Photo&#34;&gt;Lake Havasu City&lt;/a&gt;.jpg) with Ivan the Queen, Alec the Chosen, and Morrigan the Ghoul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan has a clique of few trusted people who play in his own baseball team (interestingly it&amp;rsquo;s a mixed gender team). They can protect themselves (bats) but they are different from him: he is milky white with blond hair, while they have darker skins and hair. Ivan wants Morrigan in his clique very bad, while thinks Alec is a threat to his status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec is a Chosen from a family of Chosen. They all are born in the same day, 21 of March. His father had an accident and now he&amp;rsquo;s in a wheelchair. He inherited the mantle of protector of the City. Alec has two friends who help with the slaughter: Willow and Terence (who was in Ivan&amp;rsquo;s clique before and went away because it was getting creepy). Alec also has someone who wants him dead: Vincent Bolton, the taxidermist (I came up with him).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrigan was one of the helpers of Alec&amp;rsquo;s family before dying in a bad fire, the same incident who caused Alec&amp;rsquo;s father to lose the use of his legs. Ivan and his clique disturbed her eternal sleep and now she&amp;rsquo;s back on earth craving fear and wanting to die for good. She thinks Alec smells like love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;First scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we forgot to highlight the stats (of course) and we went on with the first scene. In the classroom, where they were seeing a bad wildfire prevention PSA from a long time before (jokes jokes jokes). The professor didn&amp;rsquo;t care what they did, so Morrigan tried to talk to Alec, who &lt;em&gt;Shut her down&lt;/em&gt;. Hard. Like three times. First Morrigan was &lt;em&gt;Hurt&lt;/em&gt;, then Alec failed. My move was to introduce Ashley, a wannabe cheerleader with a caustic tongue. She shut Morrigan down (note that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a move with dice). Morrigan decided to enter her &lt;em&gt;Darkest Self&lt;/em&gt; to clear her &lt;em&gt;Hurt&lt;/em&gt; condition, and to &lt;em&gt;Lash out&lt;/em&gt;, scaring the hell out of her, feeding and escaping her darkest self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very quick darkest self. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if that&amp;rsquo;s how I intended it to work. Maybe change the escape condition to something like &amp;ldquo;When you feel ashamed of what you&amp;rsquo;ve done&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;second-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Second scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alec tried to intervene by grabbing Morrigan. Morrigan used her &lt;em&gt;Ending&lt;/em&gt; move to talk about her death, making him &lt;em&gt;Uneasy&lt;/em&gt;. Alec decided to flee. Ivan and Morrigan were left alone and started &lt;em&gt;Shutting themselves down&lt;/em&gt; and making themselves &lt;em&gt;Angry&lt;/em&gt;. They couldn&amp;rsquo;t flee because of the condition. Morrigan punched Ivan in the face. She failed. I said that Ivan received a punch, and was &lt;em&gt;Hurt&lt;/em&gt;. In the meantime I introduced the professor Wolf, who thundered to Morrigan to go to the Principal. Morrigan removed the &lt;em&gt;Angry&lt;/em&gt; condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a very weak move. I sent her to the principal but then I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow up on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;third-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Third scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We followed Alec going home at night. I introduced a threat in the shape of a tall shadow monster, who vanished when he boldly threathened him. He went home to &lt;em&gt;Gaze into the abyss&lt;/em&gt; to get info about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fourth-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Fourth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan was at a training session. He was still Angry, so I said that he probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t performing so well. The coach said to him to go home. He &lt;em&gt;Manipulated him with a promise&lt;/em&gt; convincing him he&amp;rsquo;ll win the match. The coach said ok, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to show some control in the session. He &lt;em&gt;bottled the anger&lt;/em&gt; and managed to do well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about this. There&amp;rsquo;s no Keep your Cool move or Act Under Fire, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how to handle this. And I still don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fifth-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Fifth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrigan decided to visit Caleb, who didn&amp;rsquo;t know she was back from the dead. He greeted her with a loaded shotgun, but didn&amp;rsquo;t shoot when she came closer talking about her death and activating the &lt;em&gt;Ending&lt;/em&gt; move. He was scared, though, and it showed. She decided to change tactic and she kissed him &lt;em&gt;Making a Move&lt;/em&gt; on him. He started crying saying it was all his fault, that he didn&amp;rsquo;t try his best to save her. He told her she&amp;rsquo;d better go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sixth-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f&#34;&gt;Sixth scene&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see some Alec and willow action, so I framed a scene at Willow&amp;rsquo;s home, at dinner. Willow&amp;rsquo;s mom is shipping the two of them, but they only talked about how to drive the LongShadow out of town. They resolved to seek out a witch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There weren&amp;rsquo;t moves in this scene, and sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, in conclusion, to me as an MC it worked pretty much like a standard Monsterhearts first session. Meet the teen monsters, have them fool around a bit, meet the npcs, set up for greater drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s hope future sessions will show something more of the emergent mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turmoil: The Queen</title>
      <link>http://www.fangedgames.com/post/turmoil-queen/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2016 14:44:29 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.fangedgames.com/post/turmoil-queen/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The queen is the leader of a clique of other youngsters. Their moves are about control and popularity. Their darkest self is about abusing power and trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stats:019218eaf65e751d3bb49f511f25d18b&#34;&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add 1 to one of these:
Hot 1, Cold 1, Volatile -1, Dark -1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moves:019218eaf65e751d3bb49f511f25d18b&#34;&gt;Moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get a Clique. It&amp;rsquo;s usually half a dozen close friends who look up at you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose 2 perks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are a lot (like a dozen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can defend themselves (they&amp;rsquo;re armed or trained)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They know people (who can sell them the cool drugs, or get them into the hot clubs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They share something (they are part of the same team or band)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are as family (they are ready to fight for each other)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose 2 downsides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are few (like 2 or 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are dangerous (they have no problem with violence and crime)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are scorned (by other popular groups)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are different from you (in a significant way)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They need something (from you, specifically)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose 2 moves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The shield&lt;/strong&gt;: When you shield yourself with someone from your clique, roll +Cold. On a 7-9, choose 1. On a 10+, choose 2.
- You aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid
- They aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid
- They aren&amp;rsquo;t hurt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many bodies&lt;/strong&gt;: When you make a move on someone and roll a 7-9, you can choose that someone else from your clique, who is present, is turned on instead of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And your enemies closer&lt;/strong&gt;: When someone betrays you, you gain a cold string over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/strong&gt;: When you ask someone in your clique to do something for you, roll +Hot. On a 7-9, they choose whether to do it or be Uneasy. On a 10+ they choose whether to do it or be Hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streaming&lt;/strong&gt;: When you probe the mind of someone in your clique, roll +Dark. On a 7-9, ask 1. On a 10+, ask 3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you think about ____?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your greates fear?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your greatest dream?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your beef against ____?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your stake in ____?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a miss, they can ask you 3 questions. You must answer truthfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;special-move:019218eaf65e751d3bb49f511f25d18b&#34;&gt;Special move&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you introduce someone to the clique, they become part of the clique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;darkest-self:019218eaf65e751d3bb49f511f25d18b&#34;&gt;Darkest self&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you are in your darkest self, you can use Puppeteer without rolling dice, as if you made a 10+. You escape your darkest self when someone in your clique stands up against you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;backstory:019218eaf65e751d3bb49f511f25d18b&#34;&gt;Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You really want someone to be part of your clique: Give them a hot string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You feel like someone is a threat to your status. Gain a cold string over them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Turmoil: The Ghoul</title>
      <link>http://www.fangedgames.com/post/turmoil-ghoul/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The ghoul is a monster that feels the urge to feed constantly of flesh, fear or chaos. Their moves are about morbidity and death. Their darkest self is about fighting the temptations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stats:187e5027dd65d67127638505ec865d41&#34;&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add 1 to one of these:
Hot -1, Cold 1, Volatile 1, Dark -1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moves:187e5027dd65d67127638505ec865d41&#34;&gt;Moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hunger&lt;/strong&gt;: You have an hunger for (choose 1): flesh, chaos, power, fear. When you are rolling to pursue an hunger, add 1 to rolls. When you ignore a feeding opportunity, you are uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaffected&lt;/strong&gt;: When someone gives you a hot string, you can convert it into a cold string. You can&amp;rsquo;t do it later, you have to choose in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Rest for the Wicked&lt;/strong&gt;: When you die, wait it out. Some hours later, you wake up fully healed, in your darkest self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watchful Golem&lt;/strong&gt;: When you defend someone without them ever knowing about it, mark experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ending&lt;/strong&gt;: When someone listen when you talk about your death, roll +Cold. On a success they choose if they are Scared or Turned on. On a 10+ you gain a Cold string over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;special-move:187e5027dd65d67127638505ec865d41&#34;&gt;Special move&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone lashes out at you, you can decide to be Turned On instead of Scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;darkest-self:187e5027dd65d67127638505ec865d41&#34;&gt;Darkest self&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you are in your darkest self, whenever you ignore a feeding opportunity, your victim takes a Cold string on you. You escape your darkest self when you feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;backstory:187e5027dd65d67127638505ec865d41&#34;&gt;Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone smells like love. Give them 2 hot strings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone knows about your hunger. You gain a cold string over them. They gain a cold string over you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Turmoil: The Chosen</title>

      <guid>http://www.fangedgames.com/post/turmoil-chosen/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The chosen is someone with great powers and a duty to fight evil. Their moves are about doing what&amp;rsquo;s necessary and steel themselves against hardships. Their darkest self is about refusing help and carry the weight of their responsibility alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stats:eb106ce578625776e086307f4ada4a20&#34;&gt;Stats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add 1 to one of these:
Hot -1, Cold 1, Volatile 1, Dark -1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;moves:eb106ce578625776e086307f4ada4a20&#34;&gt;Moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mercy&lt;/strong&gt;: When you spare the life of someone you have a reason to kill, take a Cold string over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing Pains&lt;/strong&gt;: When you fail to protect your friends, mark experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold Blood&lt;/strong&gt;: When you gather your courage, you can roll+Cold. On a 10+ choose 3, On a 7-9 choose 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You aren&amp;rsquo;t scared anymore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You gain +1 to your next roll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You gain a cold string on the scariest person present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can ask a question about the situation to the MC (MC must answer truthfully)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take the blow&lt;/strong&gt;: When you leap into the way and take the blow instead of someone else, roll +Volatile. On a success you are hurt and they&amp;rsquo;re not. On a 10+ you can choose to be Scared instead of Hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light the way&lt;/strong&gt;: Whenever your friends follow through on your commands or your lead, they can use the Cold Blood Move (even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the books&lt;/strong&gt;: When you research a way to fight a threat, roll with the number of people assisting you. On a 10+, choose 2. On a 7-9, choose 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask the MC a question (MC must answer truthfully)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain a cold string on your enemy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You aren&amp;rsquo;t uneasy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;special-move:eb106ce578625776e086307f4ada4a20&#34;&gt;Special move&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone else attends to your injuries, they take a Hot string over you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;darkest-self:eb106ce578625776e086307f4ada4a20&#34;&gt;Darkest self&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you are in your darkest self, as long as you&amp;rsquo;re on your own, you can&amp;rsquo;t be scared or uneasy. You escape your darkest self when there&amp;rsquo;s no more danger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;backstory:eb106ce578625776e086307f4ada4a20&#34;&gt;Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to friends you can rely on for monster-slaying support. Name them and take a Cold string or a Hot string over them (your choice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone wants you dead. The MC gives them a name and two Cold string over you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Turmoil: first draft</title>
      <link>http://www.fangedgames.com/post/turmoil-first-draft/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2016 14:24:17 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.fangedgames.com/post/turmoil-first-draft/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Turmoil is an unofficial fork of &lt;a href=&#34;http://buriedwithoutceremony.com/monsterhearts/&#34;&gt;Monsterhearts&lt;/a&gt;.  It keeps most of the interesting bits but it changes profoundly the way they behave. It takes inspiration from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.magpiegames.com/masks/&#34;&gt;Masks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.angelfire.com/indie/btw/games/rustbelt.html&#34;&gt;the Rustbelt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core belief behind this rehaul is that players should never lose completely control over the game, even if their characters are helpless, but that control can be relinquished in some measure in order to make the game interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BE WARY: THIS IS NOT THE SECOND EDITION OF MONSTERHEARTS AND THIS CONTENT IS JUST FAN CONTENT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conditions:698e58a815953b650f646ce2d71b8858&#34;&gt;Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conditions are completely different from Monsterhearts. I liked the idea of conditions that weakened you such as in masks, but I wanted them more crippling. The characters don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to manage them, so they are big obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are easier way to get rid of them, mostly by giving control over your character to someone else, such as in the case of strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conditions aren&amp;rsquo;t solely triggered by moves, but by the fiction as well. It&amp;rsquo;s common to ask &amp;ldquo;wait, are you angry?&amp;rdquo; to make the player realize they should take the condition. The player is always the only one who can decide what conditions to take, but be honest with yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you are turned on&lt;/strong&gt; you can&amp;rsquo;t spend strings. To remove it act on your impulses or give a hot string to someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you are angry&lt;/strong&gt; you can&amp;rsquo;t flee or make a move on someone. To remove it hurt someone or bottle it up. You can bottle it only 3 times. When you hurt someone you can start bottle it up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you are hurt&lt;/strong&gt; you can&amp;rsquo;t make 10+ on moves. To remove it seek help and heal or become your darkest self. If you were to become hurt while you already are hurt you become broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you are broken&lt;/strong&gt; you can&amp;rsquo;t make moves at all. To remove it seek help and heal or become your darkest self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you are scared&lt;/strong&gt; you can&amp;rsquo;t gain new strings. To remove it flee or give a cold string to someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While you are uneasy&lt;/strong&gt; you can&amp;rsquo;t make a move on someone or shut someone down. To remove it flee or fling yourself into easy relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;basic-moves:698e58a815953b650f646ce2d71b8858&#34;&gt;Basic moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the basic moves are used to provoke the other character into feeling something, while other are used to change the fictional positioning of the character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you make a move on someone&lt;/strong&gt; roll+hot. On a success they choose if they are turned on or uneasy. On a 7-9 you are turned on or uneasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you shut someone down&lt;/strong&gt; roll +cold. On a success they choose if they are hurt or angry. On a 10+ they lose whatever hot string they had on you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you lash out&lt;/strong&gt; roll+volatile. On a 10+ they choose two. On a 7-9 they choose one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they aren&amp;rsquo;t scared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they aren&amp;rsquo;t hurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you are hurt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you flee&lt;/strong&gt; roll +volatile. On a 7-9 choose one. On a 10+ choose two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s not a big scene&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you don&amp;rsquo;t give a cold string to who you&amp;rsquo;re fleeing from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you manipulate someone with a threat&lt;/strong&gt; roll+cold. On a 7-9 they must choose 1. On a 10+ they must choose 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they do what you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are scared&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to make good on your threat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;when you manipulate someone with a promise&lt;/strong&gt; roll +hot. On a 7-9 they must choose 1. On a 10+ they must choose 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they do what you want&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they are uneasy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to give something now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you gaze into the abyss&lt;/strong&gt; roll+dark. The abyss will always answer. On a 7-9 choose 2, on a 10+ choose three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It answers to what you asked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It cures you from a condition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes you happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you are not uneasy when it&amp;rsquo;s finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;strings:698e58a815953b650f646ce2d71b8858&#34;&gt;Strings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two kind of strings, used to influence people in different ways. You can spend them as currency to make the actions against the people who gave you the string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot string&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a move on someone without rolling as if you made 7-9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulate someone with a promise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask a question from this list

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what do you like about me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what&amp;rsquo;s stopping you from being with me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what&amp;rsquo;s your greatest desire?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold string&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shut someone down without rolling as if you made 7-9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulate someone with a threat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ask a question from this list

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what&amp;rsquo;s your greatest fear?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how can I force you to ____?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what do you really think of me?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;darkest-self:698e58a815953b650f646ce2d71b8858&#34;&gt;Darkest self&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The darkest self is a Condition unique to a certain Skin, that changes the rules making it easier to behave in a certain manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vampire&lt;/strong&gt;. While you are your darkest self nobody can use a string against you, and you can use hot strings as cold strings and vice-versa. You exit your darkest self when someone more powerful than you puts you in your place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Werewolf&lt;/strong&gt;. While you are your darkest self you choose whether someone is hurt or afraid when you lash out. When you make a move on someone the option &amp;ldquo;uneasy&amp;rdquo; is replaced with &amp;ldquo;afraid&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;special-moves:698e58a815953b650f646ce2d71b8858&#34;&gt;Special moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special moves describe the messy relationship a Skin has with others. It may involve sex or romance or whatever interpretation the player gives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vampire&lt;/strong&gt;: when you deflect or refuse to answer questions about yourself gain 1xp. When you open your hearth to someone lose every string you possess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Werewolf&lt;/strong&gt;: when you claim someone as your own, they can summon you at their side whenever they want, until you claim someone else.﻿&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roleplaying can be dangerous. Ok, maybe not &amp;ldquo;Juggling venomous snakes blindfolded&amp;rdquo; dangerous, but still, you can encounter some pretty awful situations and you can hurt yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re playing a game and you encounter a situation that reminds you of your recent heartbreak, or a theme comes up that makes you slightly uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg&#34;&gt;X-Card&lt;/a&gt; is a good emergency button, but it&amp;rsquo;s a nuke. Sometimes you need softer options, for example if you DO want to tackle this theme or situation, but you want to have fun, instead of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a collection of techniques that can help you tune the distance between you and the game, in order to find the spot that lets you feel more in control, more safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re like gloves, that allows you to touch itchy and stinging things without hurting yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;character-creation:4ac0809d47c4812a55ed4bc28804dd35&#34;&gt;Character creation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most games have a character creation phase, where you build the characters you will roleplay. When you act out a role your brain doesn&amp;rsquo;t know you are just playing, and it will respond to external stimuli in pretty much the same way. This means that you can easily feel the emotions of your character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting.&lt;/strong&gt;
If the time and place of the game is closer to your experience, the gloves are thinner, because your direct memories get involved. Robert Bohl, the author of &lt;a href=&#34;http://misspentyouth.robertbohl.com/&#34;&gt;Misspent Youth&lt;/a&gt; once said that the sci-fi setting in his game is like a pair of shoes you use to walk on nails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gender and sexuality.&lt;/strong&gt;
Playing someone with a gender identity or sexual orientation different from your own can make your gloves thicker. If you&amp;rsquo;re a man, consider playing a woman. If you&amp;rsquo;re genderfluid, consider playing someone with a fixed gender. If you&amp;rsquo;re gay, consider playing an asexual. If you&amp;rsquo;re heterosexual, consider playing a bisexual, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Race and culture.&lt;/strong&gt;
Playing someone who grew up in a different culture or experienced different things because of their skin color can make your gloves thicker, as well as making you understand them a bit more. This also works with wealth. If you&amp;rsquo;re middle-class, consider playing a poor person. If you&amp;rsquo;re white, consider playing an hispanic. If you&amp;rsquo;re black, consider playing an asian, and so on.
Be respectful, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;during-play:4ac0809d47c4812a55ed4bc28804dd35&#34;&gt;During play&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the gloves can be tuned moment-to-moment. It takes a while to train yourself to change them but it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;behaviour:4ac0809d47c4812a55ed4bc28804dd35&#34;&gt;Behaviour&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way you make your character act is a good way to tune the thickness of the gloves. If your character acts in a way similar to how you would in the same situation, the gloves thin themselves. Conversely, if they act in a different way, the gloves thicken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: I&amp;rsquo;m a game master, I&amp;rsquo;m currently playing an npc who just saw a giant-ass crocodile roaming the sewers. I would personally be scared as shit, babbling and saying incoherent stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good choice&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m having a lot of fun. I decide to make them do the exact same thing, because I&amp;rsquo;m comfortable with the thickness of the gloves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good choice&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m a little tired and I will make a pause after this scene. I decide I&amp;rsquo;ll make the character faint. I never fainted, so the gloves thicken because my memories don&amp;rsquo;t engage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad choice&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m at a convention and I&amp;rsquo;m anxious because of all the people. I decide I&amp;rsquo;ll make the character be scared and saying incoherent stuff. The gloves thin and I start feeling more anxious and panicky. (this actually happened once)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-and-third-person-speech:4ac0809d47c4812a55ed4bc28804dd35&#34;&gt;First and third person speech&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talking in third person helps you thicken the gloves. Talking in first person thin them. It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: I&amp;rsquo;m playing Monsterhearts as a cute little werewolf who just killed a person in her darkest self. I&amp;rsquo;m about to say I&amp;rsquo;m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good choice&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty comfortable so I act out a sobby teenager. My act is so good I feel even a bit guilty during it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good choice&lt;/strong&gt;. I had an incident and I still blame myself for it. I decide to thin the gloves by describing my character from the outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad choice&lt;/strong&gt;. I had an incident and I still blame myself for it. During the act I actually feel so bad it&amp;rsquo;s not fun anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;touch:4ac0809d47c4812a55ed4bc28804dd35&#34;&gt;Touch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Touching other players can thin the gloves for both you and them, so be careful. Some people don&amp;rsquo;t like to be touched, so maybe ask them beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example: I&amp;rsquo;m playing a vampire game, and I&amp;rsquo;m about to feed on someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good choice&lt;/strong&gt;. I say &amp;ldquo;Ok, may I grab your wrist?&amp;rdquo;. The other player nods and I grab it and say &amp;ldquo;I take your wrist and I kneel bringing it to the mouth, to feed on your veins&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good choice&lt;/strong&gt;. I just say &amp;ldquo;I take your wrist and I kneel bringing it to the mouth, to feed on your veins&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad choice&lt;/strong&gt;. I grab the wrist without asking permission, making the other player uncomfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion:4ac0809d47c4812a55ed4bc28804dd35&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By knowing and using these techniques you help making your game safer for you and the people you play with. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s enough to know that they exist, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t use them.&lt;/p&gt;
