    <h1>The roleplaying gloves</h1>
    

<p>Roleplaying can be dangerous. Ok, maybe not &ldquo;Juggling venomous snakes blindfolded&rdquo; dangerous, but still, you can encounter some pretty awful situations and you can hurt yourself.</p>

<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re playing a game and you encounter a situation that reminds you of your recent heartbreak, or a theme comes up that makes you slightly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg">X-Card</a> is a good emergency button, but it&rsquo;s a nuke. Sometimes you need softer options, for example if you DO want to tackle this theme or situation, but you want to have fun, instead of anxiety.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a collection of techniques that can help you tune the distance between you and the game, in order to find the spot that lets you feel more in control, more safe.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re like gloves, that allows you to touch itchy and stinging things without hurting yourself.</p>

<h2 id="character-creation:4ac0809d47c4812a55ed4bc28804dd35">Character creation</h2>

<p>Most games have a character creation phase, where you build the characters you will roleplay. When you act out a role your brain doesn&rsquo;t know you are just playing, and it will respond to external stimuli in pretty much the same way. This means that you can easily feel the emotions of your character.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Setting.</strong>
If the time and place of the game is closer to your experience, the gloves are thinner, because your direct memories get involved. Robert Bohl, the author of <a href="http://misspentyouth.robertbohl.com/">Misspent Youth</a> once said that the sci-fi setting in his game is like a pair of shoes you use to walk on nails.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Gender and sexuality.</strong>
Playing someone with a gender identity or sexual orientation different from your own can make your gloves thicker. If you&rsquo;re a man, consider playing a woman. If you&rsquo;re genderfluid, consider playing someone with a fixed gender. If you&rsquo;re gay, consider playing an asexual. If you&rsquo;re heterosexual, consider playing a bisexual, and so on.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Race and culture.</strong>
Playing someone who grew up in a different culture or experienced different things because of their skin color can make your gloves thicker, as well as making you understand them a bit more. This also works with wealth. If you&rsquo;re middle-class, consider playing a poor person. If you&rsquo;re white, consider playing an hispanic. If you&rsquo;re black, consider playing an asian, and so on.
Be respectful, though.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="during-play:4ac0809d47c4812a55ed4bc28804dd35">During play</h2>

<p>This is where the gloves can be tuned moment-to-moment. It takes a while to train yourself to change them but it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<h3 id="behaviour:4ac0809d47c4812a55ed4bc28804dd35">Behaviour</h3>

<p>The way you make your character act is a good way to tune the thickness of the gloves. If your character acts in a way similar to how you would in the same situation, the gloves thin themselves. Conversely, if they act in a different way, the gloves thicken.</p>

<p>Example: I&rsquo;m a game master, I&rsquo;m currently playing an npc who just saw a giant-ass crocodile roaming the sewers. I would personally be scared as shit, babbling and saying incoherent stuff.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Good choice</strong>. I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun. I decide to make them do the exact same thing, because I&rsquo;m comfortable with the thickness of the gloves.</li>
<li><strong>Good choice</strong>. I&rsquo;m a little tired and I will make a pause after this scene. I decide I&rsquo;ll make the character faint. I never fainted, so the gloves thicken because my memories don&rsquo;t engage.</li>
<li><strong>Bad choice</strong>. I&rsquo;m at a convention and I&rsquo;m anxious because of all the people. I decide I&rsquo;ll make the character be scared and saying incoherent stuff. The gloves thin and I start feeling more anxious and panicky. (this actually happened once)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="first-and-third-person-speech:4ac0809d47c4812a55ed4bc28804dd35">First and third person speech</h3>

<p>Talking in third person helps you thicken the gloves. Talking in first person thin them. It&rsquo;s as simple as that.</p>

<p>Example: I&rsquo;m playing Monsterhearts as a cute little werewolf who just killed a person in her darkest self. I&rsquo;m about to say I&rsquo;m sorry.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Good choice</strong>. I&rsquo;m pretty comfortable so I act out a sobby teenager. My act is so good I feel even a bit guilty during it.</li>
<li><strong>Good choice</strong>. I had an incident and I still blame myself for it. I decide to thin the gloves by describing my character from the outside.</li>
<li><strong>Bad choice</strong>. I had an incident and I still blame myself for it. During the act I actually feel so bad it&rsquo;s not fun anymore.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="touch:4ac0809d47c4812a55ed4bc28804dd35">Touch</h3>

<p>Touching other players can thin the gloves for both you and them, so be careful. Some people don&rsquo;t like to be touched, so maybe ask them beforehand.</p>

<p>Example: I&rsquo;m playing a vampire game, and I&rsquo;m about to feed on someone.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Good choice</strong>. I say &ldquo;Ok, may I grab your wrist?&rdquo;. The other player nods and I grab it and say &ldquo;I take your wrist and I kneel bringing it to the mouth, to feed on your veins&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Good choice</strong>. I just say &ldquo;I take your wrist and I kneel bringing it to the mouth, to feed on your veins&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Bad choice</strong>. I grab the wrist without asking permission, making the other player uncomfortable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion:4ac0809d47c4812a55ed4bc28804dd35">Conclusion</h2>

<p>By knowing and using these techniques you help making your game safer for you and the people you play with. Sometimes it&rsquo;s enough to know that they exist, even if you don&rsquo;t use them.</p>
