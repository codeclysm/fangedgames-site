    <h1>Turmoil: first playtest part 1</h1>
    

<p>Yesterday we had our first playtest session for Turmoil. I usually consider a playtest successful if it highlights problems that the rules create or can&rsquo;t go around it. Given that it&rsquo;s a campaign game, most of the problems will probably come out later. I asked the players if the game ran like Monstehearts. I received a yes, a no, and a non-committal shrug. It&rsquo;s probably too early to know for sure.</p>

<h2 id="characters:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f">Characters</h2>

<p>We made the characters in chat before the actual hangout, where we created the backgrounds. We play in the pictoresque <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/London_Bridge,_Lake_Havasu_City_-_2011_(Aerial_Photo">Lake Havasu City</a>.jpg) with Ivan the Queen, Alec the Chosen, and Morrigan the Ghoul.</p>

<p>Ivan has a clique of few trusted people who play in his own baseball team (interestingly it&rsquo;s a mixed gender team). They can protect themselves (bats) but they are different from him: he is milky white with blond hair, while they have darker skins and hair. Ivan wants Morrigan in his clique very bad, while thinks Alec is a threat to his status.</p>

<p>Alec is a Chosen from a family of Chosen. They all are born in the same day, 21 of March. His father had an accident and now he&rsquo;s in a wheelchair. He inherited the mantle of protector of the City. Alec has two friends who help with the slaughter: Willow and Terence (who was in Ivan&rsquo;s clique before and went away because it was getting creepy). Alec also has someone who wants him dead: Vincent Bolton, the taxidermist (I came up with him).</p>

<p>Morrigan was one of the helpers of Alec&rsquo;s family before dying in a bad fire, the same incident who caused Alec&rsquo;s father to lose the use of his legs. Ivan and his clique disturbed her eternal sleep and now she&rsquo;s back on earth craving fear and wanting to die for good. She thinks Alec smells like love.</p>

<h2 id="first-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f">First scene</h2>

<p>So, we forgot to highlight the stats (of course) and we went on with the first scene. In the classroom, where they were seeing a bad wildfire prevention PSA from a long time before (jokes jokes jokes). The professor didn&rsquo;t care what they did, so Morrigan tried to talk to Alec, who <em>Shut her down</em>. Hard. Like three times. First Morrigan was <em>Hurt</em>, then Alec failed. My move was to introduce Ashley, a wannabe cheerleader with a caustic tongue. She shut Morrigan down (note that this wasn&rsquo;t a move with dice). Morrigan decided to enter her <em>Darkest Self</em> to clear her <em>Hurt</em> condition, and to <em>Lash out</em>, scaring the hell out of her, feeding and escaping her darkest self.</p>

<p>It was a very quick darkest self. I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s how I intended it to work. Maybe change the escape condition to something like &ldquo;When you feel ashamed of what you&rsquo;ve done&rdquo;?</p>

<h2 id="second-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f">Second scene</h2>

<p>Alec tried to intervene by grabbing Morrigan. Morrigan used her <em>Ending</em> move to talk about her death, making him <em>Uneasy</em>. Alec decided to flee. Ivan and Morrigan were left alone and started <em>Shutting themselves down</em> and making themselves <em>Angry</em>. They couldn&rsquo;t flee because of the condition. Morrigan punched Ivan in the face. She failed. I said that Ivan received a punch, and was <em>Hurt</em>. In the meantime I introduced the professor Wolf, who thundered to Morrigan to go to the Principal. Morrigan removed the <em>Angry</em> condition.</p>

<p>It was a very weak move. I sent her to the principal but then I didn&rsquo;t follow up on it.</p>

<h2 id="third-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f">Third scene</h2>

<p>We followed Alec going home at night. I introduced a threat in the shape of a tall shadow monster, who vanished when he boldly threathened him. He went home to <em>Gaze into the abyss</em> to get info about it.</p>

<h2 id="fourth-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f">Fourth scene</h2>

<p>Ivan was at a training session. He was still Angry, so I said that he probably wasn&rsquo;t performing so well. The coach said to him to go home. He <em>Manipulated him with a promise</em> convincing him he&rsquo;ll win the match. The coach said ok, but you&rsquo;ll have to show some control in the session. He <em>bottled the anger</em> and managed to do well.</p>

<p>I was thinking about this. There&rsquo;s no Keep your Cool move or Act Under Fire, so I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to handle this. And I still don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<h2 id="fifth-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f">Fifth scene</h2>

<p>Morrigan decided to visit Caleb, who didn&rsquo;t know she was back from the dead. He greeted her with a loaded shotgun, but didn&rsquo;t shoot when she came closer talking about her death and activating the <em>Ending</em> move. He was scared, though, and it showed. She decided to change tactic and she kissed him <em>Making a Move</em> on him. He started crying saying it was all his fault, that he didn&rsquo;t try his best to save her. He told her she&rsquo;d better go away.</p>

<h2 id="sixth-scene:7d3142770a53b8f8187855b9b7e6de3f">Sixth scene</h2>

<p>I wanted to see some Alec and willow action, so I framed a scene at Willow&rsquo;s home, at dinner. Willow&rsquo;s mom is shipping the two of them, but they only talked about how to drive the LongShadow out of town. They resolved to seek out a witch.</p>

<p>There weren&rsquo;t moves in this scene, and sometimes it&rsquo;s alright.</p>

<p>So, in conclusion, to me as an MC it worked pretty much like a standard Monsterhearts first session. Meet the teen monsters, have them fool around a bit, meet the npcs, set up for greater drama.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s hope future sessions will show something more of the emergent mechanics.</p>
