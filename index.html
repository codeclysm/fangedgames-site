<p>Somewhere out there in the vast nothingness of space,<br>
Somewhere far away in space and time,<br>
Staring upward at the gleaming stars in the obsidian sky,<br>
We’re marooned on a small island, in an endless sea<br>
Confined to a tiny spit of sand, unable to escape,<br>
But tonight, on this small planet, on earth<br>
We’re going to rock civilization…<br>
  – Lyrics from “Prelude/Slam”, Pendulum</p>

<p>Starchilds is a scifi game about teenagers. The main idea came to me while looking at the stars and wondering whether I would gaze at them at the same way if I were living among them.</p>

            Turmoil is an unofficial fork of Monsterhearts. It keeps most of the interesting bits but it changes profoundly the way they behave. It takes inspiration from Masks and the Rustbelt. One of the core belief behind this game is that players should never lose completely control over the game, even if their characters are helpless, but that control must be relinquished in some measure in order to make the game interesting.

            <p>Yesterday we had the second session of Turmoil, with a new character: A ghost named Caroline, left to die in an infected orphanage a century ago. Lake Havasu city isn&rsquo;t that old, but who cares?</p>

<p>By putting the game under more stress we found a lot of things that weren&rsquo;t working as intended. I&rsquo;m calling this playtest a success.</p>

            <p>Yesterday we had our first playtest session for Turmoil. I usually consider a playtest successful if it highlights problems that the rules create or can&rsquo;t go around it. Given that it&rsquo;s a campaign game, most of the problems will probably come out later. I asked the players if the game ran like Monstehearts. I received a yes, a no, and a non-committal shrug. It&rsquo;s probably too early to know for sure.</p>

            <p>Roleplaying can be dangerous. Ok, maybe not &ldquo;Juggling venomous snakes blindfolded&rdquo; dangerous, but still, you can encounter some pretty awful situations and you can hurt yourself.</p>

<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re playing a game and you encounter a situation that reminds you of your recent heartbreak, or a theme comes up that makes you slightly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg">X-Card</a> is a good emergency button, but it&rsquo;s a nuke. Sometimes you need softer options, for example if you DO want to tackle this theme or situation, but you want to have fun, instead of anxiety.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a collection of techniques that can help you tune the distance between you and the game, in order to find the spot that lets you feel more in control, more safe.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re like gloves, that allows you to touch itchy and stinging things without hurting yourself.</p>
